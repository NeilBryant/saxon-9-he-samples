This code contains complete, working examples of both ways to add extension functions to Saxon HE (Home
Edition). Version 9.5 is required since dramatic changes were made after 9.4.

Requirements:

Java
SaxonHE9 (version 9.5)

This has been tested on Linux. It probably works with MacOS and will need minor modifications to work with MS
Windows. If you are using Windows, I suggest that you get cygwin.
